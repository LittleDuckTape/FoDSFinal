# Abstract:
The widespread consumption of short-form video content on social media platforms has raised concerns regarding its potential impact on students’ attention span and academic outcomes. Short-form video platforms are designed to deliver rapid and highly engaging content, which may influence cognitive focus and learning behavior over time. This study examines the relationship between short-form video exposure, attention span, and academic performance among Indonesian students using a secondary survey dataset collected from senior high school and university students.

Data preprocessing was conducted to construct exposure, attention, and academic performance indices based on self-reported responses. Statistical analyses, including correlation and regression modeling, were applied to examine direct and indirect relationships between variables. In addition, machine learning models were employed to predict academic performance using exposure intensity and attention-related factors. The results indicate that higher exposure to short-form video content is associated with reduced attention span, which in turn relates to lower academic performance. Although predictive performance was moderate, the findings highlight the complexity of human learning behavior and emphasize attention span as a key mediating factor.
